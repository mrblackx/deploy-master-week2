# DeployMaster: Automated Deployment Management Tool

## Overview
DeployMaster is a Python-based deployment automation tool designed to streamline application deployment processes with robust error handling, logging, and notification capabilities.

## Features
- Automated deployment steps
- Comprehensive logging
- Error handling and rollback mechanisms
- Email notifications
- Flexible configuration

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployments)
- pip package manager

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeployMaster.git
cd DeployMaster
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

### Create Deployment Configuration
Create a `deployment_config.yaml` file in the project root:

```yaml
deployment:
  steps:
    - name: Install Dependencies
      command: pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run Unit Tests
      command: python -m pytest tests/
    - name: Build Application
      command: python setup.py build
    - name: Deploy to Staging
      command: docker-compose up -d
  rollback:
    - name: Stop Docker Containers
      command: docker-compose down
  notifications:
    email: devops@company.com
```

## Usage

### Running Deployment
```bash
python deploy.py
```

### Running Tests
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

## Logging
- Logs are automatically generated in the `logs/` directory
- Each deployment creates a unique log file with a timestamp
- Logs include detailed information about each deployment step

## Customization

### Adding Deployment Steps
1. Edit `deployment_config.yaml`
2. Add new steps under the `steps:` section
3. Provide a name and command for each step

### Configuring Notifications
- Update the `notifications.email` in the configuration file
- Uncomment and configure SMTP settings in `deploy.py` for actual email sending

## Error Handling
- Deployment stops on first encountered error
- Automatic rollback is triggered
- Detailed error logs are generated

## Best Practices
- Always test deployment configuration in a staging environment
- Ensure all commands are executable
- Keep sensitive information out of configuration files

## Troubleshooting
- Check logs in the `logs/` directory for detailed error information
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Ensure proper file and directory permissions
